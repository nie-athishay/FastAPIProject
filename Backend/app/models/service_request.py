# app/models/ticket.py
#
# Purpose:
#   Describes the shape of a "ticket" document as stored in MongoDB, and
#   defines the ticket lifecycle rules (which status can move to which).
#
# Lifecycle (from the requirements):
#   NEW -> ASSIGNED -> IN_PROGRESS -> RESOLVED -> CLOSED
#   Plus the branch:
#   IN_PROGRESS -> ON_HOLD -> IN_PROGRESS
#
# A ticket document in MongoDB looks like this:
#   {
#       "id": "「uuid4 string」",
#       "title": "Laptop won't turn on",
#       "description": "...",
#       "category_id": "「category's uuid4 string」",
#       "status": "new",
#       "created_by": "「employee user's uuid4 string」",
#       "assigned_to": None,                # set once a Team Lead assigns a technician
#       "created_at": "2026-09-22T10:00:00",
#       "updated_at": "2026-09-22T10:00:00"
#   }
